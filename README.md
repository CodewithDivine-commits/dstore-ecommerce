# 🛒 D'Store - E-Commerce Clothing Website

D'Store is a simple **frontend e-commerce website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to browse clothing products, add them to a cart, and view the cart with a running total.  

This project is part of my learning journey in **web development**, and I plan to expand it in the future with **React** and backend technologies.
